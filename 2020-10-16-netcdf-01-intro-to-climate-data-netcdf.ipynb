    "## What is netCDF data?\n",
    "\n",
    "NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a hierarchical data format similar to hdf4 and hdf5. It is what’s known as a “self-describing” data structure which means that metadata (descriptions of the data) are included in the file itself and can be parsed programmatically (accessed using code) to build automated and reproducible workflows. The NetCDF format can store data with multiple dimensions. It can also store different types of data including arrays which can store geospatial imagery, rasters, terrain data, climate data, text which supports metadata and more making it highly flexible. NetCDF was developed and is supported by UCAR who maintains standards and software that support the use of this format. \n",
    "\n",
    "### NetCDF 4 for Climate Data\n",
    "The hierarchical and flexible nature of netcdf files supports storing data in many different ways. This flexibility is nice, however, similar to challenges faced with hdf5 data formats, it can be challenging when communities make different decisions about how and where they store data in a netcdf file. The netCDF 4 data model is a common standard used broadly by the climate science community to store climate data. Climate data are:\n",
    "often delivered in a time series  format (months and years worth of historic or future projected data)\n",
    "spatial in nature covering regions such as the United States or even the world\n",
    "Driven by models which require documentation making the self describing aspect of netCDF files useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The netCDF 4 model supports data stored in an array format. Arrays are used to store raster spatial data (terrain layers, gridded temperature data, etc) and also point based time series data (for example temperature for a single location over 10 years). Climate data typically have three dimensions:\n",
    "x and y representing latitude / longitude location for a  point or a grid cell location on the earth's surface\n",
    "Time\n",
    "\n",
    "The x/y locations often store a data value such as temperature, humidity, precipitation or wind direction. \n"
